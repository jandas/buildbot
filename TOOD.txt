Data API
--------

Still wicked experimental
 - docs
   - object paths
   - object attributes
 - *strong* assertions about object attributes and types
 - db API stops using datetimes?
 - good handling for types in paths - maybe e.g., i:changeid and auto-cast?
 - good support for translating "acceptable" exceptions into HTTP error codes
   without tracebacks in logs
 - support for adding links in www
   - "automatically" may be very hard
   - maybe set up "filters" with patterns?, e.g., ('change',) -> add link to
     each elt
